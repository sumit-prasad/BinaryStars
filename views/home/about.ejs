    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Swadesh is a platform dedicated to empowering non-profit organizations
      with the tools they need to create and maintain their own websites. We
      believe that every NGO should have access to a professional-looking
      website, regardless of their budget or technical expertise. That's why
      we've created an easy-to-use website builder that allows you to create a
      custom website in minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Swadesh, you can choose from a variety of professionally-designed
      templates, customize them to match your organization's brand, and add your
      own content with our drag-and-drop editor. You can also take advantage of
      features like online donations, event registration, volunteer management,
      and more. Best of all, our platform is free to use for registered
      non-profit organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we're more than just a website builder. We're also committed to
      supporting non-profits in their mission to make a positive impact on the
      world. That's why we offer educational resources, including webinars and
      tutorials, to help you make the most of your website. We also offer access
      to a community of non-profits that can offer support and advice. And we're
      committed to social responsibility, including using sustainable hosting
      and supporting environmentally-conscious causes.
